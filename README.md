# MyMLBasics
Small basic uses cases of Machine Learning / Deep learning and Python Jupiter uses

### 0_initiations : 
basics uses of typical python librairies for data  analysis. (numpy,matplotlib, seaborn,pandas,scikitlearn).
comes from firsts OpenClassRoom(OCR) courses.
Need refreshment as most of it is really basic stuff.

### 1_OCR_describe&clean :
data manipulations, preparations and some descriptives statistics.
(more advanced uses of libs and plots/ types of plots)

### 1_Stats_python : Course from Linkedin learning
data manipulations, preparations and some descriptives statistics.
(more advanced uses of libs and plots/ types of plots)

### 2_machine_learning :
uses cases on several tools in the scikitlearn lib on several type of datasets.
Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, linear regression, K-mean clustering, primary components analysis, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding.

### 3_deep_learning :
neural network uses cases on several datasets (mostly from keras.datasets : Mnist, cyphar10, ...)
- Images recognitions cases
- LSTM next frame predictions
- LSTM movie rating
- temporal series : weather forecasting


This repository needs to be improved in several ways :
- language consistency : translate french from all files
- more comprehensive commenting, to be more useful to beginners
- global improvement of techniques and methods, adding details
- creating py functions/classes.
